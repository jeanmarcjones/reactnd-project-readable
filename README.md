# Readable Project

My submission for Udacity's Redux course. Users can post content to predefined categories, comment on posts, and vote 
on posts and comments. Users can also edit and delete posts and comments.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

### Getting started

To view the project you must:

* Install node 8
* Start the server (see Server section)
* Install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* Start the development server with `yarn start`

You may use `npm` instead of `yarn` to install dependencies and start the development server.

### Server

You will need to run a local node server for this app to work, it can be downloaded from here 
[Readable API Server](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter).
