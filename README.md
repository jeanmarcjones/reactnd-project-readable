# Readable Project

My submission for Udacity's Redux course. Users can post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users can also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* Start backend sever (see Backend Server section)
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Backend Server

You will need to run a local node server for this app to work, it can be downloaded from here [Readable API Server](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter).

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
